# Homebrewed SHA256

Experimenting with a hand rolled implementation of SHA-256.

To try it out:

```
python3 sha256.py
```

By default, it hashes the string "abc". This can be changed from the bottom of the file.

Confirm by matching the output against another implementation: https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha256.html
